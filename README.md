This package can be used to calculate the mitotic spindle orientation to a surface or to cellular main axes in 4D (3 dimensions + time). This package needs:

-Surface rendering data in VRML V2.0 (.wrl) file format generated by Imaris (tested with version 9.2.1). Those files should be named according to the 4D confocal microscopy movie names. (eg: 2024-08-22_strain_name_01.wrl if the surface was produced using the movie 2024-08-22_strain_name_01.tif). Make sure there is one file per movie and at least one surface per time point during each movies when surfave are generated using Imaris

-Spindle poles tracks files (.txt) generated by ImageJ FIJI (1.52v) plugin TrackMate. See the following protocole for more details
